# XXVCLUB-TRADING-JOURNAL
A simple trading journal.

XXVCLUB TRADING JOURNAL features:
1. Core System
Instant Saving: Every trade you enter is automatically saved to your browser. You never have to worry about hitting a "save" button.
Smart Switching: You can look at your progress using simple "Points" (R-Multiples) or switch to a real "Dollar" ($) view to see your actual account growth.
Rapid Logging: A quick entry system lets you record a trade's direction, the asset pair, and the result in a few seconds.

2. Visual Dashboard
Color-Coded Progress: The calendar acts as a heat map. Days turn Green for profits, Red for losses, and Gray for breaking even, giving you an immediate visual of your "winning streaks."
Real-Time Scoreboard: A summary at the top tracks your Win Rate percentage and gives you a count of exactly how many wins, losses, and break-evens you have for the month.
Weekly Snapshots: The journal automatically adds up your results for each individual week.

3. Data Portability
Export: You can turn your entire digital history into a file to keep on your computer or open in Excel.
Import: If you move to a new laptop, you can upload that file to restore your entire journal instantly.
Picture Mode (📸): A "snapshot" button lets you download a high-quality image of your monthly calendar to share or keep in a visual folder.

4. Design & Comfort
Clean Interface: To keep things tidy, buttons don't have permanent labels. Instead, descriptions pop up only when you hover your mouse over them.
Night Mode: A light/dark toggle helps protect your eyes depending on your trading environment.
Device Flexibility: The layout is designed to stay readable whether you are at your desk or checking your stats on a phone.
